        <p>India is a country of many celebrations and traditions and one of the most important ones is Republic Day.
            This day is celebrated around India by people of all ages, especially young adults. Young adults can
            participate in various activities to celebrate Republic day. The origin behind this day started when India
            was finally freed from colonial British rule in August of 1947. The constitution of India was adopted by the
            government on November 26, 1949 and came into effect on January 26,1950. According to Republic Day 2020, in
            January 1950, India became the world’s largest democracy with an estimated population of about 359 million
            people. This completed India's movement towards becoming an independent republic with a democratic
            government system. Republic day is celebrated on 26 January every year in India. It is significant
            because it is a day to honour the constitution of independent India. Childrens and young teens hoist the
            national flag in schools and colleges around India. In the capital, New Delhi, the national flag is hoisted
            by the president. According to,Republic Day 2020 “ New Delhi hosts the nation's biggest parade. It's quite
            the spectacle.”. It is also important to know that the parade is conducted by the president and Ministry of
            Defense. Tourists are encouraged to attend this event because it showcases exhibitions of military
            equipment, the national flag and armed forces. Other than showcasing its military prowess, this event also
            promotes India’s diverse culture. Young adults of ages should attend this event as they will get to
            experience groups of people representing different cultures and religions of India. There
            are many other activities that young adults can experience and learn about the history of India.

            <li id="discover-txt">Kashmir is a region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent.The region, with a total
                area of some 85,800 square miles (222,200 square km), has been the subject of dispute between India and
                Pakistan since the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. The Kashmir region is predominantly
                mountainous, with deep, narrow valleys and high, barren plateaus. The relatively low-lying Jammu and
                Punch plains in the southwest are separated by the thickly forested Himalayan foothills and the Pir
                Panjal Range of the Lesser Himalayas from the larger, more fertile, and more heavily populated Vale of
                Kashmir to the north. The climate of the region ranges from subtropical in the southwestern lowlands to
                alpine throughout the high mountain areas. The people in the Jammu area are Muslim in the west and Hindu
                in the east and speak Hindi, Punjabi, and Dogri. </li>
