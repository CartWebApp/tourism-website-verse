                <p class="experience1">Over a dozen major cruise lines offer itineraries that feature destinations in
                    India, between them presenting options ranging from one week in Southeast Asia to months-long
                    voyages. Young adults would enjoy cruises as they get to visit different islands and territories of
                    India. Major cruise lines offering cruises to India include Crystal, Costa, Cunard, P&O Cruises,
                    Celebrity, and Holland America. </p>

                <p class="experience2">India is a popular flight destination and India receives over 68 million
                    passengers every year. Young adults are encouraged to travel to India via flights as they are the
                    fastest means of transport to India. There are many airlines that offer flights to India and some of
                    them are Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Air India, United, and Lufthansa.

                <p class="experience3">Traveling by train is one of Indiaâ€™s classic experiences. Young adults are
                    encouraged to use trains as they are often on time and take them to their destination faster than
                    any other transport other than flights. Young adults will get to experience unique trains and
                    enjoyable journeys. The national rail network covers almost the entire country. There are three
                    basic types of passenger trains in India: Inter-city trains, super-fast air-conditioned trains, and
                    local passenger trains, which stop everywhere</p>
            </li>
            <li class="Transportationindia2">
                <p class="experience4">
                    Buses go almost everywhere, usually more frequently than trains. Young adults might prefer buses
                    over trains as they are sometimes faster and easier to access than trains. Going by bus also usually
                    saves you the bother of reserving a ticket in advance. Young adults who want to take short journeys
                    around India at a quicker pace should travel using buses over trains.
